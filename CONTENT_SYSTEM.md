## 🎯 LinkedIn Strategy: Personal vs Company

### LinkedIn Personal (Ganesh Patil)
**Purpose**: Build trust, show expertise, be relatable

**Post Types**:
- Personal stories (interview failures, learning moments)
- Career advice from experience
- Behind-the-scenes of building CoreLearnly
- Opinion pieces on tech industry
- Engagement posts (polls, questions)
- DSA tips with personal commentary
- "What I learned" posts

**Tone**: Conversational, first-person, vulnerable, helpful

**Example**:
> "I failed 7 interviews before landing my first job. Here's what finally worked..."

### LinkedIn Company (CoreLearnly)
**Purpose**: Official brand presence, course promotion

**Post Types**:
- Workshop announcements & reminders
- Course curriculum highlights
- Student testimonials (future)
- DSA problem of the week
- System design quick tips
- Enrollment updates ("X spots left")
- Educational infographics

**Tone**: Professional but friendly, informative, authoritative

**Example**:
> "🎯 Workshop Alert: Free 2-day DSA + System Design workshop on Jan 10-11. Limited to 50 seats. Register now: [link]"

### Cross-Posting Rule
```
Personal → Company: Share company posts with personal commentary
Company → Personal: Never auto-crosspost (looks spammy)
```
