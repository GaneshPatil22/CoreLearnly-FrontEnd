**Design notes:**
- Quote in big bold text
- Attribution line smaller, slightly sarcastic
- Arrow indicating swipe

## SLIDE 2 (The Lie)

```
THE LIE YOU'RE
HEARING EVERYWHERE

"AI will write the code."
"DSA is outdated."
"Just learn prompting."

Sounds nice.
Feels comfortable.

But it's killing your career.
```

---

## SLIDE 3 (Reality Check)

```
HERE'S WHAT'S
ACTUALLY HAPPENING

→ Google still asks DSA
→ Amazon still asks DSA
→ Microsoft still asks DSA
→ That dream startup? DSA.

AI didn't remove DSA.

It just gave lazy people
a new excuse.
```

---

## SLIDE 4 (The Real Reason)

```
LET'S BE HONEST

People don't say
"DSA doesn't matter"
because they believe it.

They say it because
they don't want to
put in the work.

Blaming AI is easier than
solving a hard problem.
```

---

## SLIDE 5 (The Filter)

```
500 APPLICANTS.
1 CODING ROUND.

That's how companies
filter resumes.

No DSA skills?

Your resume goes
straight to the trash.

AI won't save you there.
```

---

## SLIDE 6 (The Bigger Picture)

```
EVEN IF AI WRITES
ALL YOUR CODE...

Who decides WHAT to build?
Who debugs when it breaks?
Who optimizes when it's slow?

YOU. With your brain.

The same brain DSA trains.
```

---

## SLIDE 7 (What DSA Actually Gives You)

```
DSA ISN'T JUST
FOR INTERVIEWS

It builds:

→ Pattern recognition
→ Problem decomposition
→ Logical thinking
→ Optimization mindset

These skills don't expire.
These skills don't get automated.
```

---

## SLIDE 8 (The Hard Truth)

```
THE HARD TRUTH

People skipping DSA today
are the same people who'll
blame "unfair hiring" tomorrow.

AI is a tool.
You're supposed to be the brain.

Stop looking for shortcuts.
```

---

## SLIDE 9 (CTA)

```
YOUR CHOICE.

Skip the work now.
Regret it in interviews later.

OR

Start building the skill
that actually gets you hired.

## LINKEDIN CAPTION (Post with carousel)

```
"DSA doesn't matter anymore, AI will write the code."

This is the most expensive lie you're telling yourself right now.

Here's what nobody wants to tell you:

→ Every top company still runs DSA rounds
→ The bar is actually HIGHER now (because everyone has AI assistance)
→ Companies aren't testing if you can copy-paste. They're testing if you can THINK.

Swipe through for the full reality check.

The people avoiding DSA today will complain about "unfair hiring" next year.

Don't be that person.
