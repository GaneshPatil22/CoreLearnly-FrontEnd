```

**Example:**
```
Two Pointers can solve problems 10x faster than brute force.

Most beginners loop through arrays twice when once is enough.

Here's when to use Two Pointers:

→ Finding pairs that sum to a target
→ Removing duplicates in-place
→ Reversing arrays or strings
→ Detecting cycles in linked lists

The pattern: Start pointers at opposite ends (or same end), move based on a condition.

Once you see it, you'll spot it everywhere.

Save this for your next interview prep session.

```

**Example:**
```
I mass-applied to 200+ companies in 3 months.

Got 5 callbacks. 2 interviews. 0 offers.

I was doing everything "right" - updating resume daily, applying everywhere, practicing LeetCode.

But I was missing one thing: I wasn't learning from rejections.

Then I started tracking:
- Which companies responded
- What questions I struggled with
- Where I lost confidence

Pattern emerged. Fixed it. Got 3 offers in the next month.

Rejection isn't failure. It's feedback.

What's one rejection that taught you something valuable?
