  },
  {
    question: "What is the duration of the program?",
    answer: "The complete program runs for 6 months. This includes comprehensive coverage of DSA, Low Level Design (LLD), High Level Design (HLD), and AI fundamentals."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the class schedule?",
    answer: "Weekdays: 3 live DSA classes per week. Weekends: AI fundamentals and language-specific DSA bridge sessions (Java, JavaScript, Python, Swift). All classes are conducted live online, allowing for real-time interaction and doubt clearing."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the classes live or recorded?",
    answer: "All classes are conducted LIVE online. This ensures you can interact directly, ask questions in real-time, and get personalized guidance. Recordings are provided for revision."

  {
    question: "Do I need prior programming experience?",
    answer: "Basic programming knowledge in any language is recommended. You should be comfortable with variables, loops, and functions. The program will build everything else from the ground up."
  },
  {
    question: "Will there be coding projects?",
    answer: "This program focuses on DSA problem-solving and system design case studies rather than building applications. All projects are design-focused — you'll work on real-world system design exercises like designing Uber, Netflix, etc."
  },
  {
    question: "What topics are covered in the curriculum?",
    answer: "The curriculum covers: DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms), LLD (Low Level Design & Design Patterns), HLD (High Level Design & Scalable Systems), and AI Fundamentals (tools, productivity, practical applications)."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from other courses?",
    answer: "Direct mentorship from me — not a large team or pre-recorded content. Live classes with real-time interaction. Focus on interview preparation with practical system design case studies. Plus, you learn AI tools that actually help in your day-to-day work."
